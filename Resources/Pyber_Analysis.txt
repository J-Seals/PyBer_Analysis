# Pyber Data Analysis with MatPlotLib


## Overview of Pyber Data 
The purpose of this project is to help Pyber, a ride sharing company, determine
which areas need more drivers and how much the average cost should be per ride. 
The total number of drivers per area type was calculates as well total number of
rides given per area. Average ride fares were calculated per area type by summing
up the cost for each ride and diviving that number by the total number of rides per
area. This data was then visually displayed in a line graph to identify any trends
or areas of improvement.

## Results

### Urban Areas
Urban areas have the highest number of drivers and total rides compared to suburban areas
and Rural Areas. In addition, these areas spend more on fares compared to suburban and rural
areas, making the average fare rare the lowest among the three area types.

### Suburban Areas
Suburban areas have about half the number of total rides and total drivers compared to urban
areas, but still surpass rural areas in these categories. Similarly, the total amount of fares
for suburban areas is half of the profit brought in by urban areas, and yet, still drastically
more than rural areas. This leads to the average ride cost in suburban areas to be 
noticebally higher than urban areas and slightly lower than rural areas.

### Rural Areas
Rural areas have a significantly lower number of total rides and total drivers compared to
urban and suburban areas. These areas bring in the least amount of profit in total amount
of fares, but have the highest average cost per ride. These areas are trailing behind when
compared to suburban and urban areas.

## School District Analysis Summary
Changing the ninth graders scores to Nan at Thomas High School allowed for a more accurate 
depiction and analysis of the data. The following things can be attributed to this:
1. All Charter Schools performed better than the District Schools
2. Charter Schools usually spent less on average per student but still performed better 
3. Charter Schools usually have a significantly smaller student body population than District
Schools and usually performed better
4. Thomas High School went from being a low performing school to one of the top performing
High Schools in the district
